      <h3> This chart bellow shows us that among 34 countries, Brazil has the most expensive iPhone 8 (the latest release) in the world. Why is that? A good way to start would be to see the amount of tax imposed on imported manufactured retail goods.</h3>

The cost to make an Iphone 8 today is around $370.25. The lowest price to sell the Iphone 8 is in America, at $924, while the highest price is in Brazil, for $1,377.00. Why is the Iphone so expensive in countries such as Brazil, Denmark and even China ($1,126.00), where the common sense is that most of the Iphones are fabricated over there?

To understand this, we must first look at where and how each component is composed into the Iphone, and then look at another factor that jumps the prices of those high end products up: import tariffs (or more commonly referred to as import taxes).

Bellow itâ€™s a chart where we can see each component used to make an Iphone, and also where they are from originally. Then we will see on the next chart the amount of tax imposed to manufactured products imported from other countries to the United States, and in the next chart, how much each of the 34 countries shown imposes of tariffs to their own imported products.
